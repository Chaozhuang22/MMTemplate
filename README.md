# Personal Website Template: Setup & Customization Guide
Hi there!

This is a modified version of [the minimal mistake template](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) I use to build [my personal website](https://chaozhuang22.github.io/).

1. **Setup**

   - Clone the repository through VS code to your local machine.

2. **Configuration**

   - Navigate to the root directory of the project.
   - Open the `_config.yml` file. This is the main configuration file and is essential for setting up your site.

Editing the `_config.yml` file:

   - `title`: Replace the existing title with the title of your website.
   - `email`: Update it with your email address.
   - `description`: Add a brief description of your website or a tagline.
   - `url`: Set the base URL of your website.
   - `repository`: Update the repository field with the path to your GitHub repository.
   - `author`: Replace the existing author name with your name and the associated social media profiles.

3. **Posts**

   - Navigate to the `_posts` directory where all the blog posts are stored.
   - You can find a sample post, referring to which you can write your new posts.
   - Ensure that the URLs and usernames for each platform are correctly updated.
   - Images are stored in the `assets` directory.

4. **Deployment**

   - The deployment is done by pushing the local repository to Github, which will do the publishing automatically.
